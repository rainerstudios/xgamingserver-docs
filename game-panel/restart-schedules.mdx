<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into the Panel">
    1. Go to [panel.xgamingserver.com](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
    2. Log in with your credentials.
    3. Click on your **server** to open its dashboard.

    Fill in the required fields:

    - **Schedule Name**: e.g. `Daily Restart`
    - **Enabled**: Toggle ON to activate immediately
    - **Only When Online**: Optional ‚Äî use if schedule should only run while the server is online
    - **Cronjob Time**: Input the CRON expression that defines when the task runs

    > üí° Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) if you're new to CRON syntax.

    Example for daily at 3AM: `0 3 * * *`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tasks">

    Once the schedule is created, you'll be taken to the **task list**.

    1. Click **"New Task"**.
    2. Choose an **action**:
       - `Send Power Action` ‚Äì e.g., restart, stop, start
       - `Send Command` ‚Äì run a specific command
       - `Create Backup` ‚Äì (if backup is available for your server)
    3. Set a **Delay (in seconds)** ‚Äî if you want it to wait a bit before running. For example:
       - Task 1: Stop server (0 sec)
       - Task 2: Start server (10 sec)
    4. Click **"Create Task"**.

    üí° _Tip: For a daily restart, create two tasks: Stop ‚Üí Start, with 10‚Äì30s delay between them._

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Wait">
    That‚Äôs it\! The schedule will now run according to the CRON time you set. You can always:

    - **Edit** the schedule or tasks.
    - **Enable/disable** schedules.
    - **Manually run** the schedule with the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button if you want to test it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Schedule Examples and What You Can Do

Schedules on XGamingServer give you powerful automation ‚Äî from server restarts to running backups or even sending commands in-game. Below are real-world examples and use cases to inspire how you can use them effectively.

## Auto Restart Server

Keeping your server fresh and lag-free is easy with a daily restart.

- **CRON**: `0 4 * * *`
- **Task 1**: Send Power Action ‚Üí Stop (0s delay)
- **Task 2**: Send Power Action ‚Üí Start (30s delay)
- **Use Case**: Restart server daily at 4AM when no one is online.

## Automated Backups

Take daily or weekly backups to avoid losing progress.

- **CRON**: `0 2 * * *`
- **Task**: Create Backup (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Daily backup at 2AM. Make sure you're on a plan that supports this feature.

## in-Game Warning \+ Restart

Send players a warning before kicking them for a restart.

- **CRON**: `0 5 * * *`
- **Task 1**: Send Command `say Server will restart in 1 minute!` (0s delay)
- **Task 2**: Send Power Action ‚Üí Restart (60s delay)
- **Use Case**: Restart server every morning with player notification.

##  Auto-Clear In-Game Items

Run cleanup commands on sandbox games (like Minecraft or Rust).

- **CRON**: `*/30 * * * *`
- **Task**: Send Command `/clearitems` or your game‚Äôs equivalent (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Prevent item lag by auto-clearing dropped items every 30 minutes.

##  Schedule Server Downtime

Want the server offline during certain hours?

- **Schedule 1 (Stop)**: CRON: `0 0 * * *` ‚Üí Task: Send Power Action ‚Üí Stop (0s delay)
- **Schedule 2 (Start)**: CRON: `0 6 * * *` ‚Üí Task: Send Power Action ‚Üí Start (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Keep server offline from midnight to 6AM to reduce load or enforce offline hours. (Requires two separate schedules)

##  Reset PvP Zones or Events

Automate in-game events that reset maps or PvP zones.

- **CRON**: `0 */6 * * *`
- **Task**: Send Command `/resetarena` (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Reset event zones every 6 hours in survival or competitive servers.

## Pro Tips

- Use `Send Command` to run mods/scripts or custom cleanup
- Combine multiple tasks for multi-step automation
- Use `Only When Online` toggle to avoid unnecessary runs
- Adjust delays carefully to avoid overlapping actions

##  Advanced Setup

Want to do something really specific like:

- Auto-switch game modes?
- Change configs via command?
- Rotate maps or mods?
  Yes, you can schedule those too ‚Äî as long as your game supports commands/scripts to trigger them. Just schedule them using the **Send Command** action.
