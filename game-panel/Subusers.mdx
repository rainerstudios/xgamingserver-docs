title: "Managing Users and Subusers"
---

Learn how to add, configure, and manage subusers for your XGamingServer instance in the Pterodactyl Panel. This guide will help you delegate access securely while maintaining control over your server.

---

## Overview

The **Pterodactyl Panel** allows server owners to collaborate with others by adding **subusers**. Subusers are secondary accounts that can be granted limited permissions to perform specific tasks (e.g., managing files, sending console commands).

### Key Concepts

- **Primary User**: The account that created the server. It has full administrative access.
- **Subusers**: Additional users invited by the primary user. They have restricted access based on assigned permissions.

<info>
  Subusers are ideal for delegating responsibilities to trusted admins or friends without sharing your primary account credentials.

## Adding a Subuser

### Step 1: Access Subuser Settings

1. Log in to the [Pterodactyl Panel](https://your-ptero-domain.com).
2. Select the server you want to manage from the server list.
3. Navigate to the **Subusers** tab in the server dashboard.

### Step 2: Invite a Subuser

1. Enter the **email address** of the user you want to invite.
   - Ensure the email matches their Pterodactyl account.
2. Assign permissions (see [Permission Levels](#permission-levels) below).
3. Click **Create Subuser** to send the invitation.

<warning>
  The invited user must already have a Pterodactyl account registered with the same email address. If they don’t, ask them to create one before proceeding.
</warning>

## Permission Levels

When inviting a subuser, you can assign specific permissions. Below is a detailed breakdown of each permission and its use cases:

| Permission            | Description                               | Use Case Examples                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Console Access**    | View/send commands to the server console. | Admins who need to run game commands.                           |
| **Start/Stop**        | Control server power state.               | Moderators who restart the server after crashes.                |
| **File Management**   | Edit, upload, or delete server files.     | Developers managing plugins/mods/configs.                       |
| **Backup Management** | Create/restore backups.                   | Backup operators ensuring data safety.                          |
| **User Management**   | Add/remove other subusers.                | Rarely recommended; avoid granting unless absolutely necessary. |

<info>
  Grant only the permissions necessary for the subuser’s role. For example, a moderator might need **Console Access** but not **File Management**.
</info>

## Editing Permissions

If you need to adjust a subuser’s permissions:

### Step 1: Locate the Subuser

1. Go to the **Subusers** tab in the server dashboard.
2. Find the subuser you want to modify.

### Step 2: Modify Permissions

1. Click **Edit** next to the subuser.
2. Adjust their permissions as needed.
3. Save changes.

<tip>
  Changes take effect immediately. There’s no need to log out or restart the server.
</tip>

## Removing a Subuser

If a subuser no longer needs access to your server:

### Step 1: Locate the Subuser

1. Go to the **Subusers** tab in the server dashboard.
2. Find the subuser you want to remove.

### Step 2: Delete the Subuser

1. Click **Delete** next to the subuser.
2. Confirm the action when prompted.

<warning>
  Removing a subuser revokes all access immediately. Ensure this is intentional, as the subuser will no longer be able to interact with your server.
</warning>

## Best Practices

To ensure secure and efficient subuser management, follow these guidelines:

### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**

- Only grant permissions necessary for the subuser’s role. For example:
  - A moderator might need **Console Access** but not **File Management**.
  - A developer might need **File Management** but not **User Management**.

### 2. **Regular Audits**

- Periodically review your subusers and their permissions.
- Remove inactive or unnecessary subusers.

### 3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

- Require subusers to enable 2FA on their accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

### 4. **Avoid Sharing Primary Credentials**

- Never share your primary account credentials with others. Always use subusers for delegation.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Subuser Not Receiving Invitation

- **Cause**: The email may not match their Pterodactyl account, or the invitation email was filtered as spam.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify the email matches their Pterodactyl account.
  2. Ask the subuser to check their spam/junk folder.
  3. Resend the invitation if necessary.

### Issue: Subuser Lacks Expected Access

- **Cause**: Incorrect permissions were assigned during setup.
- **Solution**:
  1. Go to the **Subusers** tab.
  2. Edit the subuser’s permissions and ensure all required permissions are enabled.

### Issue: Subuser Cannot Log In

- **Cause**: The subuser’s Pterodactyl account may be inactive or locked.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ask the subuser to verify their account status.
  2. Ensure they can log in to the Pterodactyl Panel independently.

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Admin Servers**

For servers with multiple admins, assign roles based on responsibilities:

- **Lead Admin**: Full access except **User Management**.
- **Moderator**: Console Access and Start/Stop permissions.
- **Developer**: File Management and Backup Management.

### 2. **Event-Based Access**

Grant temporary access to subusers for specific events (e.g., tournaments):

1. Add the subuser before the event.
2. Remove the subuser after the event concludes.

### 3. **Automated Monitoring**

Use subusers with limited permissions (e.g., **Console Access**) to monitor server health via third-party tools.
